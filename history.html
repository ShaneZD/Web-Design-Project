                            The first heavy metal acts are considered to be Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and
                            Deep Purple, often referred to as the “unholy trinity”. They are most often
                            credited as the founders of the genre, but other bands, including Steppenwolf,
                            are often thrown into the conversation, too.
                            However, U.S. west coast band Blue Cheer actually recorded the first metal song,
                            which was a January 1968 cover of “Summertime Blues.” The same month also
                            saw the release of Steppenwolf’s debut album that included their signature track,
                            “Born to be Wild.” Despite these being seen as early examples of metal music, it is
                            accepted today that these were widely experimental, and it wasn’t until Led
                            Zeppelin’s 1969 debut and the emergence of Black Sabbath and Deep Purple in
                            1970 as leaders in the genre that metal was truly born.
                            The 70s saw metal shed its blues rock origins, with acts like Motorhead and Iron
                            Maiden infusing elements of punk, and increasing tempos with more frantic
                            drums. Despite so many influential acts coming out, metal was still being shunned
                            by the music industry in favour of the punk movement, forcing smaller bands to
                            release music without the support of a label.
                            Metal began to branch out into sub-genres, with glam and hair metal acts like
                            Motley Crue and Poison spearheading the movement. Thrash metal became
                            huge, with bands such as Metallica and Megadeth reaching ever larger audiences,
                            thanks in part to metal acts being played on MTV, which started airing in 1981.</p>

                        <p class="p2">Fans of heavy metal music, commonly referred to as "Metalheads", have created
                            their
                            own subculture that encompasses more than just appreciation of the style of music. Fans
                            affirm
                            their
                            membership in the subculture or scene by attending metal concerts (an activity seen as
                            central
                            to
                            the subculture), buying albums, growing their hair long in most to (almost always) all cases
                            (although some metalheads do wear their hair short; one very famous example is late 70s to
                            80s-era
                            Rob Halford), wearing jackets or vests often made of denim and leather, adorned with band
                            patches
                            and often studs, and since the early 1980s, by contributing to metal publications.

                            The metal scene, like the rock scene in general, is associated with alcohol, tobacco and
                            drug
                            use,
                            as well as riding motorcycles and having many tattoos. While there are songs that celebrate
                            drinking, smoking, drug use, gambling, having tattoos and partying, there are also many
                            songs
                            that
                            warn about the dangers of those activities. The metal fan base was traditionally working
                            class,
                            white and male in the 1970s, and since the 1980s, more female fans have developed an
                            interest in
                            the style. Also, its popularity and interest in it has grown among African Americans and
                            other
                            groups recently.

                            The influence of popular entertainment on behavior continues to be debated. A
                            2006 study by the RAND Corporation, for example, found that 12- to 17-year-olds
                            who frequently listen to music with sexually degrading lyrics were almost twice as
                            likely to engage in sexual activities within the next two years as peers who rarely
                            or never listen to such songs. Many anecdotal accounts have also implicated
                            immoderate exposure to extreme heavy metal as contributing factors to acts of
                            criminal violence.

                        </ul>
                        <p class="p3">Another aspect of heavy metal culture is its fashion. Like the metal music, these
                            fashions have changed over the decades, while keeping some core elements. Typically, the
                            heavy
                            metal
                            fashions of the late 1970s – 1980s comprised tight blue jeans or drill pants, motorcycle
                            boots
                            or
                            hi-top sneakers and black T-shirts, worn with a sleeveless kutte of denim or leather
                            emblazoned
                            with
                            woven patches and button pins from heavy metal bands. Sometimes, a denim vest, emblazoned
                            with
                            album
                            art "knits" (cloth patches) would be worn over a long-sleeved leather jacket. As with other
                            musical
                            subcultures of the era, such as punks, this jacket and its emblems and logos helped the
                            wearer
                            to
                            announce their interests. Metal fans often wear T-shirts with the emblem of bands.

                            Around the mid-2000s, a renaissance of younger audiences became interested in 1980s metal,
                            and
                            the
                            rise of newer bands embracing older fashion ideals led to a more 1980s-esque style of dress.
                            Some of
                            the new audience are young, urban hipsters who had "previously fetishized metal from a
                            distance".
