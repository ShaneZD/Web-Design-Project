                    <h2>What is Metal?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and
                        early
                        1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and United States. With roots in blues rock, psychedelic
                        rock and acid rock, heavy metal bands developed a thick, monumental sound characterized by
                        distorted
                        guitars, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats and loudness.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <h2>Where did Metal come from?</h2>
                <p>
                    Beginning in the late 1970s, bands in the new wave of British heavy metal such as Iron Maiden and
                    Saxon
                    followed in a similar vein. By the end of the decade, heavy metal fans became known as "metalheads"
                    or
                    "headbangers". The lyrics of some metal genres became associated with aggression and machismo, an
                    issue that has at times led to accusations of misogyny.

                    During the 1980s, glam metal became popular with groups such as Bon Jovi, Mötley Crüe and Poison.
                    Meanwhile, however, underground scenes produced an array of more aggressive styles: thrash metal
                    broke
                    into the mainstream with bands such as Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth and Anthrax, while other extreme
                    subgenres such as death metal and black metal became and remain subcultural phenomena. Since the
                    mid-1990s, popular styles have expanded the definition of the genre. These include groove metal and
                    nu
                    metal, the latter of which often incorporates elements of grunge and hip-hop.

                    <h2>Heavy Metal</h2>
                    <p>
                        Heavy metal, genre of rock music that includes a group of related styles that are
                        intense, virtuosic, and powerful. Driven by the aggressive sounds of the distorted
                        electric guitar, heavy metal is arguably the most commercially successful genre of
                        rock music.
                        The rhythm in metal songs is emphatic, with deliberate stresses. Weinstein observes that the
                        wide
                        array of sonic effects available to metal drummers enables the "rhythmic pattern to take on a
                        complexity within its elemental drive and insistency".In many heavy metal songs, the main
                        groove is characterized by short, two- or three-note rhythmic figures - generally made up of
                        eighth
                        or 16th notes. These rhythmic figures are usually performed with a staccato attack created by
                        using
                        a palm-muted technique on the rhythm guitar.

                <h2>Nu-Metal</h2>
                <p>
                    Nu-metal is a controversial genre, used to group bands such as Limp Bizkit, Linkin
                    Park, and Slipknot, who would emerge from the U.S. in the 1990s, although
                    Slipknot in particular are regularly classified as a thrash or death metal band.
                    Nu metal bands have drawn elements and influences from a variety of musical styles, including
                    multiple
                    genres of heavy metal. Nu metal rarely features guitar solos or other displays of musical technique;
                    the
                    genre is heavily syncopated and based on guitar riffs. Many nu metal guitarists use seven-string
                    guitars
                    that are down-tuned to produce a heavier sound. DJs are occasionally featured in nu metal to provide
                    instrumentation such as sampling, turntable scratching and electronic backgrounds. Vocal styles in
                    nu
                    metal include singing, rapping, screaming and growling. Nu metal is one of the key genres of the new
                    wave of American heavy metal.
                </p>

                <h2>Trash Metal</h2>
                <p>
                    Thrash metal (or simply thrash) is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music characterized by its
                    overall
                    aggression and often fast tempo. The songs usually use fast percussive beats and low-register guitar
                    riffs, overlaid with shredding-style lead guitar work. The lyrical subject matter often includes
                    criticism of The Establishment, opposition to armed conflicts, and at times shares a disdain for the
                    Christian religion with that of black metal. The language is typically direct and denunciatory, an
                    approach borrowed from hardcore punk.

                    The genre emerged in the early 1980s as musicians began fusing the double bass drumming and complex
                    guitar stylings of the new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) with the speed and aggression of
                    hardcore punk. Philosophically, thrash metal developed as a backlash against both the conservatism
                    of
                    the Reagan Era and the much more moderate, pop-influenced, and widely accessible heavy metal
                    subgenre
                    of glam metal which also developed concurrently in the 1980s.
